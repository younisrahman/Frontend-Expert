        A pattern used at the beginning of a <b>ruleset</b> for choosing which
        elements will be affected by the declarations. There are a variety of
        different selector types:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Type selector</b>: Selects all of the elements of a specific HTML
          tag. For example, <span>h1</span> would select all
          <span>&lt;h1&gt;</span> elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Class selector</b>: Selects all elements with a specific HTML class
          attribute. Class selectors are prefixed with a <span>.</span>, so for
          example <span>.foo</span> would select all HTML elements with the
          attribute <span>class="foo"</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ID selector</b>: Selects an element with a specific HTML ID
          attribute. ID selectors are prefixed with a <span>#</span>, so for
          example <span>#bar</span> would select the HTML element with the
          attribute <span>id="bar"</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Attribute selector</b>: Selects all elements with a specific HTML
          attribute set to a specific value. These are surrounded by
          <span>[]</span> and use a <span>=</span> as a delimiter between the
          attribute name and value. For example,
          <span>[type="submit"]</span> would select all elements with a type
          attribute set to "submit".
          <br />
          <br />
          Excluding the value will select all elements with the attribute set to
          any value. For example, <span>[type]</span> would select all elements
          with the type attribute set, regardless of the value.
          <br />
          <br />
          Attribute selectors can also use special syntax for basic pattern
          matching within the value. There are a variety of options here, but
          these are some of the more common ones:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span>[href*="algoexpert.io"]</span> would select all elements
              with an href attribute with the text "algoexpert.io" at any
              location.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>[href$="algoexpert.io"]</span> would select all elements
              with an href attribute with the text "algoexpert.io" at the end of
              the value.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>[href^="https://algoexpert.io"]</span> would select all
              elements with an href attribute with the text
              "https://algoexpert.io" at the beginning of the value.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Combinator</b>: Combines multiple selectors to select elements
          based on their location in the DOM. There are a few types of
          combinators:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Descendant combinator</b>: Represented by a single space, in
              the format <span>selector1 selector2</span>. Selects all elements
              that match <span>selector2</span> and are a descendant of an
              element matching <span>selector1</span>. A descendant does not
              need to be a direct child (e.g. the selected element's grandparent
              could match selector1).
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Child combinator</b>: Represented by <span>&gt;</span>, in the
              format <span>selector1 &gt; selector2</span>. Selects all elements
              that match <span>selector2</span> and are a direct child of an
              element matching <span>selector1</span>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Sibling combinator</b>: Represented by <span>~</span>, in the
              format <span>selector1 ~ selector2</span>. Selects all elements
              that match <span>selector2</span> and are a sibling of an element
              matching <span>selector1</span>. The element matching
              <span>selector2</span> must come after the element matching
              <span>selector1</span>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Adjacent sibling combinator</b>: Represented by <span>+</span>,
              in the format <span>selector1 + selector2</span>. Selects all
              elements that match <span>selector2</span> and have an element
              matching <span>selector1</span> directly before them in the DOM.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
